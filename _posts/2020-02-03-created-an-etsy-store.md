I've added an [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/QuiteKeen) with some of the 3d printed things I designed.

The files to print your own for any of them are still available here: [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/social/23599-billiam/prints), but this should help make some of them available for some people.
