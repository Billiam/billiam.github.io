This is the obiligatory "I've update my blog, and I'm serious about adding regular content, guys. From here on, things will be different," post.

This site now sports the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) jekyll theme and with it, better responsive support.

Additionally, the site has a new vanity domain, a real and appropriate moniker ("Fail Fast"), more room for large images, and a marginally less grumpy author avatar.

I still need to add a nice banner image and favicon, but it's not pressing.

I'm looking forward to the content I've been meaning to write. Fingers crossed.
