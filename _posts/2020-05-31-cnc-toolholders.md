While working on some other projects, I mocked these guys up real quick to help
organize some of the tools and accessories I'm using with my CNC right now.

The design is simple, and they're just carved in scrap 3/4" plywood, so recreating
them if when tools change won't be a big deal.

Eventually, I'm planning to have these in drawers instead, but it's a good start.

To make an accurate profile for complex (mostly two-dimensional) parts, I
took a photo zoomed in at a distance (to minimize perspective distortion), with a ruler visible.

This photo can be imported into Fusion 360 as a canvas, and the ruler used to calibrate it.
