I've released [finalver](http://billiam.github.io/finalver), the versioning specification you're probably already using.

Finalver is most appropriate for assets that change hands and update regularly, codifying and standardizing one of the most popular[^1] versioning systems in active use today.

It's currently at version `old.old.final`, and moving toward version `old.old.final-final` soon.
