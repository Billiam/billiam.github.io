I've released [Wheeler](http://billiam.itch.io/wheeler), an Open Broadcaster overlay.


![Wheeler overlay showing pedal, steering and shift inputs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post/2015/wheeler/demo.gif)

Wheeler is designed to replace pedal cams (sock cams) in racing games for streamers. It displays configurable racing wheel, pedal, shift and handbrake input and plays nicely with multiple input devices.

Wheeler is priced at pay-what-you-want, but all support is appreciated.

Additional details and setup instructions can be found at [Wheeler's Itch.io page](http://billiam.itch.io/wheeler)
